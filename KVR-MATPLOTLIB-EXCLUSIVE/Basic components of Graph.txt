Basic components of Graph
==================================
=>A graph has the following basic components:
=>Figure or chart area:  The entire area covered by the graph is known as a figure.
					It can be also considered as a canvas or chart area also.
=>Axis:   These are the number of lines generated on the plot. Basically, there are two axis X and Y-axis.
=>Artist: The components like text objects, Line 2D objects, collection objects, etc.
=>Titles: There are few titles involved with your charts such as Chart Title, Axis titles, etc.
=>Legends: Legends are the information that represents data with lines or dots.

Steps – how to create graphs using matplotlib
===============================================================================================
Step 1:   Installation of matplotlib
		Examples: pip install matplotlib
 
Step 2:		 import module
			Without instance:    import matplotlib.pyplot
			With instance:         import matplotlib.pyplot as  plt 
								OR 
							  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

Step 3 : Choose desired plot type (graph type)
Step 4 : Give proper labels to axis, categories
		A graph is made up of two-axis i.e. X and Y-axis. 
		In this step label them as per the need as well as apply proper labels for categories also.
Step 5: Add data points
		The next point is to add data points. 
		Data points depict the point on the plot at a particular place.
Step 6:  Add more functionality like colours, sizes etc
		To make your graphs more effective and informative use different colours and different sizes.
 ========================================================================================== 
Matplotlib provides the following types of graphs in python:
		Line plot
		Bar graph
		Histogram
		Pie chart
		Scatter plot OR chart
